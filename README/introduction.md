## Introduction

THe original goal of this project was to become a game engine, but I toned it down to a physics engine. As such, some names (GameoBject and GameAttribute) have the word Game. This is still a physics engine at the end of the day.

### Maven
I don't know how to use Maven! Maven is a project building tool with its own commands and conventions, none of which I follow (I only learned about the code conventions the night before writing this). All Maven commands are run with 
```
mvn [arguments]
```
The only practical argument is compile, which compiles the src files and puts them in target. Hopefully I'll get to learning how to use it, because it seems useful.

### Inspiration
The  format was inspired by [a blog post I found](https://gamasutra.com/blogs/MichaelKissner/20151027/257369/Writing_a_Game_Engine_from_Scratch__Part_1_Messaging.php) while googling around for tutorials. It talks about building it from complete scratch (which admittedly is a really large consumer of time). As such, this project is only an abridged version of the entire engine building process (graphics are covered by javafx). 

Please note that I only read the first three of the blogs (and only the first one is practical).
