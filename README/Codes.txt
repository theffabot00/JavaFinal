Would make this a csv, but I want READABILITY
Ill csv it when I make the final project

0XX: System 
(TODO: make close window a message and now a public boolean)

1XX: Graphics
101: created new javafx scene (data length 1: the scene created)

2XX: Input
201: key pressed (keycode and time)
202: key released (keycode and time)

3XX: Unallocated

4XX: Unallocated

5XX: Physics
501
502: object moved (the object, translation vector, rotation in radians)
503: force displacement (the object, translation vector)

1NXX: Game Logic
1100: create a new scene (height, width)
1501: create a new object (object, points)

**Notes:** 
1NXX should have a corresponding NXX in the modules. the 1 denotes game logic.
I skipped 3 and 4 by accident; i have 3 for physics in my notebook.
